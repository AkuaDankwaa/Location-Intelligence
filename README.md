# Home-Location Analysis 

## A fully functional EXAMPLE of location inltelligence project using POSTGRESQL - POSTGIS and Python (using Jupyter notebook)


This project is mainly focused on finding a suitable home for our clients - Josh and Mary Garcia, who want to buy a home. As the real estate agent, my task is to find houses that meet their criteria. In my next appointment with them I have to present a list and produce a map. 

Clients' criteria as follows:

 -a singlefamily house with at least three bedrooms. 
 
 -they want a relatively modern house (built in 1990 or later) with a twocar garage. 
 
 -they can afford to pay in the upper $100,000's but no more than $225,000.

-the Garcias would like their two young children to attend either Melvin Elementary School or Arnie Primary School. 

-the home would be located close to Terry Athletic Park, where one of the children frequently attends afterschool athletic activities.

## Useful tips

1. Once you have postgresql installed with posstgis extension, load the schema file in this project 'Home_Analysis(Pordenton).sql'

2. Run the 'home_location_analysis queries.sql'

3. View the attached location map in QGIS
